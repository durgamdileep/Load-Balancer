# ⚖️ Load Balancer

A load balancer is a component (hardware or software) that `distributes incoming network or application requests` across multiple servers to ensure:

- ⚡ **Optimal use of resources**  
- 🚀 **Better performance and response time**  
- 🛡️ **High availability**  
- 🔄 **Fault tolerance** (if one server fails, traffic is sent to others)

## 🧩 Load Balancing Algorithms

Load balancing algorithms are of two types: `Static` and `Dynamic`

### 🟢 Static Load Balancing Algorithms
(Decisions made without real-time server state)

- 🔁 **Round Robin**  
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Weighted Round Robin**  
- 🎲 **Random**  
- 🌐 **IP Hashing**  
- 🔗 **Consistent Hashing**  
- 👥 **Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)**  
- 🌍 **Geo-Based Load Balancing**

### 🔵 Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms
(Decisions made using current server metrics)

- 📉 **Least Connections**  
- 🏋️‍♂️📉 **Weighted Least Connections**  
- ⏱️ **Least Response Time**  
- 🖥️ **Resource-Based (CPU / Memory aware)**  
- 🔄 **Adaptive Load Balancing**  
- ⭐ **Priority-Based**
